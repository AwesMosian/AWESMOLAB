# AWESMOLAB - Disease Prediction Web Application

Description:
The AWESMOLAB project is a robust Machine Learning (ML) web application designed to predict various diseases using state-of-the-art algorithms. Leveraging Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS, I engineered the development of this application, ensuring a scalable and user-friendly interface.

Key Achievements:

1. Engineered the development of AWESMOLAB, a machine learning-deployed web application predicting various diseases with a focus on robustness and scalability.
2. Implemented advanced data validation techniques to ensure accuracy in the analysis and recommendations.
3. Integrated Python programming language along with NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow libraries, achieving a remarkable prediction accuracy of 95%.

This project showcases my proficiency in full-stack development, machine learning, and data validation. I invite you to explore the project repository for a detailed look at the source code and further insights into the development process.
